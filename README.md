# Setup.ipa
setup.app

doesnt work yet. trying to figure out a way to make a icloud removal.
basically i took the setup.app from the dmg rootfs of ios 9.3.4 for iphone 4s
modified a coupled things to try and see if i can use it for ios 9.3.5.
used fce 365's firmware manager program to make a patched file of the "setup" file located in setup.app in the dmg roofs
created a payload folder and moved "setup.app"into the folder
compressed zipped the folder and renamed the file to Setup.ipa
though maybe i could use cydia impactor to install the app

but no cigar

cant get passed lockdown
i tried to see if i could possible install it to a different phone that wasnt locked and it was loading and installing but cydia impactor crashes at the end.
maybe its because the im on 10.3 and the ipa i modified was for 9.3.5
however, i just sorda gave up 
fuck it lol

here it is 
maybe someone can do something with it
